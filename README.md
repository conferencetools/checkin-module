[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/conferencetools/checkin-module/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/conferencetools/checkin-module/?branch=master) [![Code Coverage](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/conferencetools/checkin-module/badges/coverage.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/conferencetools/checkin-module/?branch=master) 

This is a check in module designed to be used as a door list for conferences. 
 
The plan is to allow this to be used as a stand alone application, however the MVP will
depend on using the tickets module alongside to register the delegates into the system.
